# LASSO Regularisation and Shrinkage Methods

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that explores regularization techniques with a particular focus on LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). The notebook demonstrates the application of LASSO using a real-world dataset, providing insights into its advantages over Ridge regression and showcasing its implementation in Python using scikit-learn.

## Overview

### LASSO Regularisation
LASSO is a powerful regularization technique that enhances model simplicity and interpretability by shrinking some coefficients exactly to zero. This property makes LASSO particularly useful for feature selection, effectively eliminating less important predictors from the model.

### L1 vs. L2 Regularisation
The notebook explains the differences between L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) regularization:
- **Ridge Regression (L2 norm)**: Reduces the magnitude of coefficients but does not set them to zero.
- **LASSO Regression (L1 norm)**: Can reduce coefficients to zero, thus performing variable selection.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is the "SDG 15 Life on Land" dataset, which includes various environmental indicators. The target variable for prediction is the "Biodiversity Health Index."

### Key Sections

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Separating features from the response variable.
   - Standardizing the features.

2. **LASSO Regression in scikit-learn**:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training a LASSO regression model.
   - Extracting and interpreting model coefficients.

3. **Model Assessment**:
   - Comparing the performance of LASSO with basic linear regression and Ridge regression.
   - Evaluating models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on training and testing data.
   - Visualizing model predictions against actual values.

### Results
The notebook demonstrates that LASSO not only provides a parsimonious model by eliminating irrelevant features but also achieves comparable or better predictive performance compared to Ridge regression and least squares regression. 

### Visualization
The notebook includes plots to visually compare the predicted and actual values, providing an intuitive understanding of the model's performance.

## Usage
